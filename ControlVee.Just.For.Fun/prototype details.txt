thread the needle AKA 'Chunk'

keep the thread in the middle of the needle hole

the needle hole is a path that moves left or right

prototype 1:

no thread - use square like symbol - @
no path, use pipe like symbol - | |

if hit then take a life off
if pass 15 seconds add a life

include countdown timer
include number of lives
include username

1 lvl = 15 seconds of play

path example:

go straight path =

|1| * 4
|1|
|1|
|1|  for the length of 50% of the height of the viewbox

go left path =

\1\ * 4
1\1\
12\1\
123\1\

go right path = (go left path (inverted))

\1\ * 4   =     /1/
1\1\           /1/1
12\1\         /1/12
123\1\       /1/123

each lvl is 15 seconds
each second produces 1 chunk *ON LVL 1*
	- a chunk = \1\ OR |1| OR /1/

each second produces 2 chunk *ON LVL 2*
	- a chunk = \1\ OR |1| OR /1/

each second produces 3 chunk *ON LVL 3*
	- a chunk = \1\ OR |1| OR /1/

each second produces 4 chunk *ON LVL 4*
	- a chunk = \1\ OR |1| OR /1/
